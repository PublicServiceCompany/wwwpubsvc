        <td><p class="content-text">Public Service Company is a business of people focused on people who are focused on business. Got it? Public Service Company was founded in 2012 to address the dearth of excellent ethical execution in the advertising, marketing, strategy, public performance and media content creation spaces. We provide brands with hyperspecific strategies developed with efficient attainment of client goals in mind. We engage on budget, milestones and outcomes, never losing sight of the fact that business is done by people with paramount personal value. The bottom line is important to us, but only because it is important for the CMO or PM to hit the number that gets the bonus needed to put the kids through law school. Key performance indicators are only important to us if they are used to justify the capital injection needed to bring a great product nobody knows about to a greatful market waiting for it to be invented.</p>
